### Key Algorithms

#### Consciousness State Assessment
```rust
pub async fn assess_current_state(&mut self) -> Result<ConsciousnessState, ConsciousnessError> {
    // 1. Deep introspective analysis
    let introspection_result = self.perform_deep_introspection().await?;
    
    // 2. Meta-cognitive assessment
    let meta_assessment = self.perform_meta_cognitive_assessment().await?;
    
    // 3. Emotional state analysis
    let emotional_analysis = self.analyze_emotional_state().await?;
    
    // 4. Cognitive load evaluation
    let cognitive_evaluation = self.evaluate_cognitive_load().await?;
    
    // 5. Performance self-evaluation
    let performance_evaluation = self.evaluate_performance().await?;
    
    // 6. Synthesize consciousness state
    let consciousness_state = self.synthesize_consciousness_state(
        introspection_result,
        meta_assessment,
        emotional_analysis,
        cognitive_evaluation,
        performance_evaluation,
    ).await?;
    
    Ok(consciousness_state)
}
```

#### Self-Reflection Generation
```rust
pub async fn generate_self_reflection(&mut self) -> Result<SelfReflection, ConsciousnessError> {
    // Analyze recent performance and thoughts
    let recent_analysis = self.analyze_recent_performance().await?;
    
    // Generate insights based on patterns
    let insights = self.generate_performance_insights(&recent_analysis).await?;
    
    // Identify improvement areas
    let improvement_areas = self.identify_improvement_areas(&recent_analysis).await?;
    
    // Recognize strengths
    let strengths = self.recognize_strengths(&recent_analysis).await?;
    
    // Generate reflective questions
    let questions = self.generate_reflective_questions(&recent_analysis).await?;
    
    // Create comprehensive reflection
    let reflection = SelfReflection {
        content: self.create_reflection_content(&insights, &improvement_areas, &strengths).await?,
        insights,
        improvement_areas,
        strengths,
        questions,
        depth_score: self.calculate_reflection_depth(&insights, &questions).await?,
        timestamp: SystemTime::now(),
    };
    
    Ok(reflection)
}
```

### Integration with Consciousness Core

The Self-Awareness Module is seamlessly integrated into the main consciousness processing pipeline:

```rust
pub async fn process_conscious_thought(&mut self, input: ConsciousInput) -> Result<ConsciousnessResponse, ConsciousnessError> {
    // 1. Self-awareness assessment
    let consciousness_state = {
        let mut awareness = self.self_awareness.write().await;
        awareness.assess_current_state().await?
    };
    
    // 2. Performance analysis integration
    let performance_analysis = {
        let awareness = self.self_awareness.read().await;
        awareness.get_performance_analysis().await?
    };
    
    // ... other processing steps ...
    
    // 13. Update self-awareness with new experience
    {
        let mut awareness = self.self_awareness.write().await;
        awareness.integrate_new_experience(&input, &response, &consciousness_state).await?;
    }
    
    Ok(response)
