RAG is a tree-like graph structure that uses attention mechanisms to capture and model long-term dependencies in text data. In RAG, each node represents an entity or topic in the sentence, and edges connect nodes based on their mutual attention. This attention-based graph representation enables RAG to identify patterns and entities in complex sentences, such as noun phrases, clauses, and sentences with syntactic complexity. RAG has proven effective in various NLP applications, including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and machine translation.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[529,29989,5205,29989,29958,13,3492,526,263,8444,319,29902,20255,29889,2,29871,13,29966,29989,1792,29989,29958,13,9544,7420,18865,29954,297,697,14880,2,29871,13,29966,29989,465,22137,29989,29958,13,4717,29954,313,4789,1264,6212,2509,12367,29897,338,263,9554,2948,304,5613,6361,3357,479,9068,8906,491,278,10550,414,472,27955,28284,23753,928,11796,292,29889,18865,29954,338,263,5447,29899,4561,3983,3829,393,3913,21609,593,291,13336,29879,304,10446,322,1904,1472,29899,8489,9962,297,1426,848,29889,512,18865,29954,29892,1269,2943,11524,385,7855,470,11261,297,278,10541,29892,322,12770,4511,7573,2729,373,1009,5478,950,21609,593,291,29889,910,21609,593,291,29899,6707,3983,8954,28936,18865,29954,304,12439,15038,322,16212,297,4280,25260,29892,1316,408,28313,29876,16549,29879,29892,11845,29879,29892,322,25260,411,5222,21229,2034,29883,13644,29889,18865,29954,756,16413,11828,297,5164,405,13208,8324,29892,3704,19688,16455,1039,29879,29892,4257,7855,19679,29892,322,4933,13962,29889],"total_duration":2967277910,"load_duration":12170990,"prompt_eval_count":41,"prompt_eval_duration":126068973,"eval_count":142,"eval_duration":2828257064},"quality":{"approved":false,"composite_score":66,"reasons":[{"field":"selfAwareness","message":"Self-awareness 75% < 85%"},{"field":"metaCognitiveDepth","message":"Meta-cognitive depth 0 < 4"},{"field":"empathyAuthenticity","message":"Empathy 80% < 90%"}],"recommendations":[{"type":"quality","message":"Increase introspective loop frequency and state tracking fidelity."},{"type":"quality","message":"Raise reflection steps; enable deeper chain-of-thought planning (bounded)."},{"type":"quality","message":"Adapt prosody and sentiment calibration to the user context."}],"agentType":"generic","changeId":"unknown","context":{}},"compliance":null,"performance":null}
