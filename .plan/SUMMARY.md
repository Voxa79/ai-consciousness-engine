# Project Summary — .kiro

This document summarizes the current state of the `.kiro` project area and the most actionable insights for an MVP.

## Scope Covered
- hooks (3):
  - consciousness-quality-validator.md
  - ethical-compliance-guardian.md
  - performance-optimization-trigger.md
- steering (5):
  - consciousness-ai-guidelines.md
  - ethical-reasoning-framework.md
  - multimodal-interaction-patterns.md
  - neuromorphic-performance.md
  - quantum-ml-optimization.md

## Current State of Advancement
- Specification maturity: high. Each hook has clear responsibilities, scoring/threshold logic, and Supabase schemas; steering files define comprehensive standards.
- Implementation readiness: hooks appear production-ready to implement as runtime services:
  - Quality Gate (consciousness): scoring (self-awareness, ethical, meta-cognitive, empathy), CI/CD workflow, dashboards, recommendations.
  - Compliance Guardian: composite compliance (Ethics, GDPR, AI Act), auto-blocking, remediation, audit trail, alerts, dashboard.
  - Performance Trigger: detection (latency, CPU, NP-hard patterns), targeted optimization (quantum/neuromorphic/hybrid), metrics storage.
- Gaps: integration glue (HTTP APIs, payload schemas), environment config, security/PII handling, and minimal dashboards need instantiation.

## Key Components & Purposes (Concise)
- Quality: ensure “consciousness” standards remain ≥85% with trend monitoring and recommendations.
- Compliance: guarantee ethical/regulatory conformance with blocking, remediation, and full auditability.
- Performance: maintain latency/energy/resource targets by proactively switching/optimizing execution engines.
- Steering: normative references that inform thresholds, weights, and acceptance criteria.

## MVP (1–2 jours)
1) Expose 3 HTTP endpoints (Node/Edge runtime):
   - POST /quality/validate
   - POST /compliance/check
   - POST /performance/trigger
2) Persist to Supabase using the provided schemas (create tables if absent).
3) Minimal dashboard routes:
   - GET /quality/overview, GET /compliance/overview, GET /performance/overview
   - GET /compliance/alerts
4) Config & Security:
   - .env: SUPABASE_URL/ANON_KEY, mode audit-only vs enforcement, thresholds, alert webhooks.
   - PII minimization in logs/audits, role separation for writes vs reads.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Requests to the 3 endpoints return pass/block or shouldOptimize with scores/reasons.
- Violations (high/critical) are logged and visible via overview/alerts endpoints.
- Quality gate failure blocks CI (as configured) with clear messaging.
- Supabase tables populated; dashboards return non-empty aggregates after test traffic.

## Next Steps
- Implement API contracts (see `hooks/api/contracts.md`).
- Create Supabase tables (SQL in hooks docs) and plug environment variables.
- Add minimal monitoring handlers.
- Prepare Postman collection (optional) for quick end-to-end tests.
