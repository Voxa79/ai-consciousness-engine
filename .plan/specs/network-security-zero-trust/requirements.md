# Requirements Document - Network Security Zero-Trust

## Introduction

This specification defines the implementation of a comprehensive zero-trust network security architecture for the Consciousness Engine platform. The objective is to create an advanced network security layer with micro-segmentation, real-time threat detection, and automated response capabilities that protect consciousness-level AI interactions while maintaining ultra-high performance requirements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Network Security Engineer, I want a zero-trust network architecture with micro-segmentation, so that lateral movement attacks are prevented and each service is isolated with minimal necessary access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a service attempts to communicate THEN it must be authenticated and authorized via mTLS
2. WHEN network traffic flows THEN it must be encrypted end-to-end with TLS 1.3 minimum
3. WHEN a pod is deployed THEN it must be assigned to appropriate network policies automatically
4. WHEN suspicious network activity is detected THEN traffic must be automatically blocked within 100ms
5. WHEN network policies are violated THEN alerts must be generated and logged immediately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Security Operations Center analyst, I want real-time network threat detection and automated response, so that network-based attacks are neutralized before they can impact consciousness services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network traffic is analyzed THEN machine learning models must detect anomalies with >95% accuracy
2. WHEN a DDoS attack is detected THEN mitigation must be activated within 30 seconds
3. WHEN malicious traffic patterns are identified THEN source IPs must be automatically blocked
4. WHEN intrusion attempts occur THEN forensic data must be collected automatically
5. WHEN threat intelligence indicates new IOCs THEN network filters must be updated within 5 minutes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Compliance Officer, I want network traffic monitoring and audit trails, so that we can demonstrate compliance with security regulations and investigate incidents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network traffic flows THEN all connections must be logged with metadata
2. WHEN audit reports are requested THEN network activity data must be available for 12 months
3. WHEN compliance scans run THEN network security posture must be automatically assessed
4. WHEN policy violations occur THEN detailed audit trails must be generated
5. WHEN data exfiltration is attempted THEN all related network flows must be tracked and recorded

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps Engineer, I want automated network policy management, so that security policies are consistently applied across all environments without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are deployed THEN network policies must be automatically generated based on service metadata
2. WHEN environments are promoted THEN network security configurations must be consistently applied
3. WHEN policy changes are made THEN they must be validated before deployment
4. WHEN network configurations drift THEN automatic remediation must be triggered
5. WHEN new vulnerabilities are discovered THEN network protections must be automatically updated

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Performance Engineer, I want high-performance network security, so that consciousness-level AI interactions maintain sub-100ms latency while being fully protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network security is active THEN latency overhead must be <10ms per hop
2. WHEN traffic inspection occurs THEN throughput must not be reduced by more than 5%
3. WHEN encryption is applied THEN CPU overhead must be <15% per core
4. WHEN network policies are evaluated THEN decision time must be <1ms
5. WHEN threat detection runs THEN it must not impact application performance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Cloud Architect, I want multi-cloud network security consistency, so that security policies work uniformly across AWS, Azure, and on-premises environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying across clouds THEN network security policies must be cloud-agnostic
2. WHEN traffic crosses cloud boundaries THEN encryption and authentication must be maintained
3. WHEN cloud-specific features are used THEN they must integrate with the unified security model
4. WHEN failover occurs THEN network security must be maintained across all environments
5. WHEN new cloud providers are added THEN integration must be achieved within 2 weeks
